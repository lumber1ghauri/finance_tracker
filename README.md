Personal Finance Tracker

A Ruby on Rails-based web application to help users manage their personal finances by tracking incomes, expenses, and budgets. The system includes user authentication, transaction categorization, and a responsive UI using Rails views and Tailwind CSS.

Project Overview

The goal of this application is to help users:

Track income and expenses.

Categorize their financial transactions.

Set budgets and monitor financial goals.

Visualize data through a dashboard (planned).


The project is built using:

Ruby on Rails (v7+)

PostgreSQL

Tailwind CSS (via Rails)

Devise for user authentication


Completed Features

âœ… User Authentication

Devise is configured and integrated.

User registration, login, logout, and password management fully functional.


âœ… Models and Migrations

Models created: User, Category, Transaction, Expense, Income, Budget

All migrations for these models are completed and functioning.

Associations such as belongs_to and has_many are set correctly.


âœ… Controllers & Basic CRUD

TransactionsController fully set up:

index, show, new, edit, create, update, destroy actions.

Validations added in model for amount, date, and category presence.


CategoriesController, IncomesController, and ExpensesController also structured similarly.

Category and transaction forms are functional.


âœ… Basic Views

Transactions views (index, form, show) are created and render properly.

Navigation structure is partially in place.

Flash messages implemented for create/update/destroy.


âœ… Routing

All standard RESTful routes implemented.

Root path configured to welcome#index or dashboard#index (depending on state).


Pending / Upcoming Features

ðŸŸ¡ Budget Tracking Module

BudgetController actions are scaffolded but require logic implementation.

Need ability to set monthly/weekly budgets per category.


ðŸŸ¡ Dashboard View

Needs a proper dashboard view showing:

Monthly income vs expenses

Top categories

Budget usage

Planned graphs (maybe using Chartkick or similar)



ðŸŸ¡ Error Messages & Form Validation UI

Form error messages should be displayed cleanly in the views.

Currently backend validations exist, but no frontend UX polish yet.


ðŸŸ¡ User-based Data Filtering

Currently all transactions/incomes/expenses are global.

Need to scope models and controllers so users only see their own data.


ðŸŸ¡ Visual Improvements

Integrate proper layout using Tailwind CSS.

Add icons, better spacing, mobile responsiveness, etc.


ðŸŸ¡ Testing (RSpec or Minitest)

No automated tests added yet.
